# IsYourBrainOkGame

https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/blob/master/TLG/if%20logic%20challenge.md

Game created to meet requirements of above project.

Console based game that asks a few questions to determine if your brain is ok after what we've been through in the pandemic (i.e. forgetting how to socialize or even wanting to).

I based this off of an SNL gameshow sketch.

Started off rough and has been refactored along the way to account for user input errors and for efficiency and organization.

Work in progress
