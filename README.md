# IsYourBrainOkGame

https://github.com/csfeeser/Python/blob/master/TLG/if%20logic%20challenge.md

Game created to meet requirements of above project.

Console based game that asks a few questions to determine if your brain is ok after what we've been through in the pandemic (i.e. forgetting how to socialize or even wanting to).

I based this off of an SNL gameshow sketch.

Currently "works" but doesn't account for incorrect user inputs and not organized as well as I would like.

Work in progress
